            <p class="content" style="margin-top: 10px;">During my 3 months at StubHub, I had the opportunity to wear multiple hats and work on different projects as an intern. The projects I worked on range from ticket delivery, system messaging, to designing internal tools.<br></p>
            <p class="smalltit" style="margin-top: 120px;">Impact</p>
            <p class="content">Collaborating with my Design Manager and Product Managers, I produced <span class="highlight">5</span>&nbsp;service blueprints that captured core problems within StubHub’s ticket delivery & fulfillment services. Then, I designed a new template system for StubHub that aims to solve some of the core problems discovered.
            </p>
            <p class="smalltit">Problems on the Surface</p>
            <p class="content">The story begins with a meeting between the design team and a product manager(PM). In the meeting, the PM mentioned some ongoing problems in StubHub’s processes. Those problems were very general, like high amounts of Customer Support calls and delayed processes. I was given the task to dig down to the root of these problems and potentially, solve them.
            <p class="smalltit">Finding the Cause
                </p>
            <p class="content">At first, these problems were so general that I found it difficult to navigate. Fortunately, my design mentor suggested a direction, specifically, a method, that I could use to get down to the causes of these problems - <span class="highlight">Service Blueprints</span>&nbsp;. 
            </p>

            <p id="caption" class="caption">Service Blueprint Example(https://www.nngroup.com/articles/service-blueprints-definition/)/</p>
            <p class="content">Service blueprints illustrate a comprehensive understanding of an organization’s <span class="highlight">service and the underlying technical processes</span>&nbsp; — both seen and unseen to the user. By laying out StubHub’s core ticketing service, I thought it might be easier for me to pinpoint the stages at which the problems emerge.
            </p>
            <p class="smalltit">Making the Blueprint
            </p>
            <p class="content">StubHub is a large company with diverse teams. To create a service blueprint that covers the whole service line, I reached out to different teams and scheduled Q&A meetings to learn what each team was doing. 
            </p>
            <img class="aligned" src="assets/img/StubHub/generalBP.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
            <p id="caption" class="caption">The service blueprint I created(details not shown for confidentiality purposes).</p>
            <p class="content">These meetings were similar to user interviews, as I prepared protocols beforehand, actively listened to the team members during the meeting, and recorded necessary information for the blueprint. Each team was like a puzzle piece, by putting all of the pieces together, I ended up with a nice service blueprint that summarizes StubHub’s core services.
            </p>
            <p class="smalltit">More Blueprints - Smaller Ones
            </p>
            <p class="content">After I created the blueprint, however, I still could not find the causes of the problems. In order to capture the entire service without being too overwhelming, the description for each step on the blueprint was intentionally kept concise and general. The problems, on the other hand, seem to exist in the technical details of certain processes.
            </p>
            <img class="aligned" src="assets/img/StubHub/fourBP.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
            <p id="caption" class="caption">From left to right: Transfer Tickets, Physical Tickets, PDF Tickets, Barcode Tickets.</p>
            <p class="content">I decided to make smaller blueprints that specifically capture the delivery & fulfillment process of StubHub’s services. This time, I created a service blueprint for each of StubHub’s 4 core ticket media: mobile transfer tickets, physical tickets, PDF tickets, and Barcode tickets.
            </p>
            <p class="smalltit">Taking Out the Roots
            </p>
            <p class="content">The smaller blueprints were able to capture the backend technical processes in much fuller details(Yes!).  As I was analyzing these root causes, I discovered that a lot of the problems resulted from StubHub’s inconsistent communication system. 
            </p>
            <p class="content" style="margin-top: 100px;font-size:32px;line-height: normal;color:black;"><img class="icon" src="assets/img/StubHub/Imagine.svg"><span class="highlight"> Imagine - </span>
            </p>
            <p class="content" style="margin-top: 25px;font-size:32px;line-height: normal;color:black;">You could not make it to the concert and just sold your tickets on StubHub. 
            </p>
            <p class="content" style="margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:130px;">Now, you received an email with instructions on how to deliver your tickets to your buyer, and a confirm button. You thought you would receive the sale money after you delivered your tickets, but guess what - your sale money will be delayed if you don’t tap the confirm button! (Note: this is an fictional analogy of the findings).
            </p>
            <p class="smalltit">Critical Templates</p>
            <p class="content">After I presented my findings to the team, my next task was to improve StubHub’s current email system. To begin, I gathered 5 critical email templates based on StubHub’s data.
            </p>
            <img class="aligned" src="assets/img/StubHub/Critical Templates.png" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
            <p class="smalltit">Key Elements of an Email</p>
            <p class="content">By analyzing these emails, I identified some recurring elements that are present in most of the them -
            </p>
            <img class="aligned" src="assets/img/StubHub/components.png" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
            <p class="content">To improve upon the current system, my goal was to iterate upon these existing elements while trying to give them a more modern look & feel.
            </p>
            <p class="smalltit">Redesigned Prototypes</p>
            <img class="aligned" src="assets/img/StubHub/Gmail Mockup.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
            <p class="content">The redesigned prototypes have a look & feel that better illustrates StubHub's branding as a ticketing service platform. StubHub's core purple color makes this new email system consistent with StubHub's website and mobile apps.
            </p>
            <p class="content" style="margin-top: 25px;font-size:32px;line-height: normal;color:black;">Redesigned Elements - Event Info</p>
            <img class="aligned" src="assets/img/StubHub/TicketTemplate.png" style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
            <p class="content">One of the elements that is heavily redesigned in the new system is the section of event information. 
            </p>
            <img class="aligned" src="assets/img/StubHub/eventInfoRedesign.png" style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
            <p class="content">The new design heavily uses imagery that creates a sense of excitement when users see StubHub's emails. Seeing the performer, even as a picture, will induce the feeling of actually seeing the performer in person. Also, the font sizes and layout were updated to adhere to StubHub's newest design guidelines.
            </p> 
            <img class="aligned" src="assets/img/StubHub/different placement.png" style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
            <p class="content">Another important change is that the position of event information section in an email is moved up to the beginning part. This change in position is a possible solution to one of the core problems discovered in Service Blueprints - <span class="highlight">Forgetful Users</span>.</p> 
            <br><p class="content"><span class="highlight">By nature, StubHub's service cycle is long.</span> As a seller, you might get your tickets sold months after you list them. As a buyer, your tickets might arrive a long time after you purchase them. Therefore, the when the users get emails like "upload your tickets on time" or "your tickets are arrived", It would take time for them to realize which concert the emails are about. </p> 
            <br><p class="content">Moving the event information section to the beginning of the email, users will instantly realize the subject event of the emails received and remember which stage they are at with the tickets. </p> 
            <p class="smalltit">Other Elements</p>
            <p class="content">Several other elements in the original templates were redesigned to keep up with StubHub's newest brand voice.</p> 
            <img class="aligned" src="assets/img/StubHub/otherchange.png" style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
            <p class="content"><span class="highlight">This is an ongoing project.</span> Feel free to reach out to me for the lastest updates! :)</p> 
            <p class="smalltit">Things I Learned</p>
            <p class="content">The biggest takeaway from this project was the experience of conducting user research on a company’s technical processes. When a company becomes large, responsibilities are distributed into many smaller branches, which can loosen the connections in-between processes. The “user research” I did for this project was novel, as my users were different development teams. Aside from learning about the technical processes underlying the user experience, I gained a better understanding on how products and services at large-scale companies operate as a whole. </p>
