                    <p>In Summer 2019, I was lucky to intern at one of the largest hardware companies in the world. Lenovo is a multinational technology company that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells personal computers, smartphones, and other electronic devices. I interned at Lenovo‚Äôs Advanced System Design Center in Shenzhen, China, with the Computer Vision team.

                    <p>For the Computer Vision Team, one of the tasks is data-training. One of the tools they used was an internal data-labelling website.
                        As useful as the website was, it was not easy to learn. So, partnered with an SWE intern, we identified the pain points of the website and proposed
                        a 2.0 version, which was approved and shipped 2 months later.

                    <p>One of the main achievements of my team this year was automated photo recognition. I was tasked to incorporate the new technology into the existing
                        Lenovo Photo Album. I brainstormed 5 potential use cases and turned them into prototypes. Through many sessions of critiques and iterations, I 
                        successfully shipped two features to the Photo Album App:

                    <h2>ü§ñ Understanding AI-Driven Design</h2>
                    <p>In the design process and frameworks that I have learned, it was always a problem-driven approach. I would first spend a few weeks to look for potential problems and user needs before
                        thinking about solutions. However, in this internship, there were multiple times when I was trying to find problems with a already established technology - a "solution".
                    </p>
                    <p>This felt strange in the beginning. When searching for problems with a solution, it was hard for me to go as broad as I would normally. But, through countless chats with the staff designers,
                        I gradually learned how to navigate the problem space with a solution in mind. I started to realize that having a solution in mind can serve as a direction for my exploratory research, making
                        me focused on the problems that could potentially be the right locks for the key in my hands.
