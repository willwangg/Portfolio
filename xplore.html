SDAF is one of the main contributors of the amazing architecture on campus, and one of their goals is to better showcase their works through an improved touring experience.

                    <p>Aside from field studies, we interviewed the current Triton Tour leaders to understand the reasons behind the Triton Tour’s design.

                <div class="content">
                    <p>After summarizing the problems, we started to look at the existing solutions. This allowed us to discover potential gaps between the current market and users’ pain points. 
                    </p>
                    <p>We evaluated the existing products tourists might use during their tour on five factors: Customizability - Whether the experience is personalized, Informativeness Whether there are enough information of places, Interactiveness - Whether the experience is interactive or not, Ease-of-Use - How easy is it to understand and enjoy the experience, and Accessibility - Whether the experience is the same across a wide range of user types & use cases.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Graph</h2>
                    <p>From the graph, we see that our main competitor - the Triton Tour - does a great job at being interactive(in-person experience), being easy-to-use(entirely guided by the tour leader), and being accessible(anyone who is not deaf or blind can have the same experience). 
                    </p>
                    <p>However, the Triton Tour is not really good at covering all the necessary information in one hour, and, across all the other current solutions, none of them really succeeds in satisfying this factor. Also, since the route is fixed, the Triton Tour is not really customized.

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Based on our discovery of current problems and our analysis of current solutions, we came up with three main criterion for our app: Accessible, Customizable, and Informative

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Before delving into brainstorming, we needed to understand who we are really designing for. 
                        We broke down the concept of “tourists” of UC San Diego into three types of identity and listed the pain points of each persona.
                    </p>
                    <p>Another thing we discovered was that, when users are on a tour, their mindset generally falls 
                        somewhere on the following spectrum:
                    </p>
                    <p>Instead of a fixed point, a natural, fruitful exploring experience stems from a dialectical 
                        relationship between the foraging state and the wanderer state. During a tour, the user’s 
                        mindset is constantly moving on the spectrum.
                    </p>
                    <p>As we understand such dynamics, we hope our app will not only support this dynamic, but also 
                        promote the constant interchanging between the two sides of the spectrum.

                <div class="content">
                    <p>In order to make the app more informative, one of the key things is a clear information architecture. For this app, we decided the endpoint of a typical experience to be entering the detail page of places - as reaching a stop of a tour. So, we started to brainstorm potential use cases and points of entry for the place’s detail page.

                    <p>On the place detail page, a lot of information is being displayed in a single, scrollable interface. We wanted to layout the information in the best way so that users can absorb the information without being overwhelmed. 
                    </p>
                    <p>We came up with three versions of the interfaces, and conducted a preference test with five users to gather their preferences on these interfaces.
                    </p>  
                    <p>It is also important for us to consider how the detail page will be previewed during a tour. So we also conducted a test on the layouts of information during tour interfaces.

                <div class="content">
                    <p>For this app, we stuck with the official color palette of UC San Diego. But, since this is a touring app, we wanted to make the UI as welcoming and up-beat as possible. Therefore, we showed our design screens to five users and asked them to use different adjectives to describe feelings they got from the UI. The adjectives used were from the Microsoft Desirability Toolkit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    From the survey responses, we were getting positive feedback from our users, and we wanted to continue in this direction in our design.

                <div class="content">
                    <p>One of the responses we got from our initial survey was - most of the tourists wanted to tour with someone from the school, because they felt like it would be more interactive. Being a mobile app, it is inherently hard for us to compete with in-person tours for interactivity, but we used this data as an inspiration for the customized tour interfaces in our UI.
                    </p>
                    <p>For our Tour Customization, we decided to use an avatar that guides through the entire process. By using the avatar, we hope to make the customization process more interesting and add up a sense of interactivity.</p>
                    <p>After our sketch, we felt like the process was too long, so we prioritized the essential customizations and reduced the process to only three steps.

                    <p>Since it is a touring app, a lot of the use cases will be outdoor. And being in Southern California, sometimes the sunlight can be really strong. Thanks to my fellow designer Yvonne Hou, We found a tool that can simulate extreme conditions onto the interfaces, and we tested our prototype under strong sunlight. 
                    </p>
                    <p>One significant change we made during the testing was changing the color of our buttons. The contrast between yellow with white can be really blurred out in extreme sunlight conditions. The later color pairing both has good contrast and is still recognizable under overcast conditions.
