                    <p>To improve, we must first understand the problems within the current experience. So, we conducted field studies and went on our school’s official campus tour, the Triton Tour. After recording the interactions that happened during tours, we made a word-cloud of the things that occurred frequently.
                    </p>
                    <img src="Images/xplore/wc.png" class="challenge">
                    <p>Aside from field studies, we interviewed the current Triton Tour leaders to understand the reasons behind the Triton Tour’s design. Using the connections of SDAF, we sent out a survey to prospective students and tourists at San Diego to gather their opinions of a good touring experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>Based on the data collected from these three methods, we concluded four problems within the current touring system:

                    <p>After discovering problems from the Triton Tour, we evaluated other existing solutions. This allowed us to discover potential gaps in the current market that our app could potentially fill. 
                    </p>
                    <p>We evaluated the existing products people might use during tour on five factors: 
                    </p>
                    <ul class="bullet">
                        <li>Customizability</li>

                    <p>From the graph, we see that our main competitor - the Triton Tour - does a great job at being interactive(in-person experience), being easy-to-use(entirely guided by the tour leader), and being accessible(anyone who is not deaf or blind can have the same experience). 
                    </p>
                    <p>However, the Triton Tour is not really good at covering all the necessary information in one hour, and, across all the other current solutions, none of them really succeeds in satisfying this factor. This finding gave us a signal of where our app could stand in the current market.

                    <p>Instead of a fixed point, a natural, fruitful exploring experience stems from a dialectical 
                        relationship between the foraging state and the wanderer state. During a tour, the user’s 
                        mindset is constantly moving on the spectrum.

                    <p>One of the responses we got from our initial survey was - most of the tourists wanted to tour with someone from the school, because they felt like it would be more interactive. Being a mobile app, it is inherently hard for us to compete with in-person tours for interactivity, but we used this data as an inspiration for our Tour Customization feature.
                    </p>
                    <p>We decided to use an Tour Leader avatar that guides users through the entire process. By using the avatar, we hoped to make the customization process more interesting and introduce another sense of friendliness to our app.</p>

But being in Southern California, sometimes the sunlight can be really strong, so, I wanted to test our prototypes under the sun. Thanks to my talented fellow designer Yvonne Hou, we found a tool that can simulate extreme conditions onto the interfaces, and we tested our prototype under extreme sunlight.
