                    <p>In China, teenagers lack a platform to express their creativity. I joined the Youtopia in the summer of 2019. Starting from an editor and now the Head of Media, I witnessed the organization's growth from "another student-org" to the biggest fashion and art community in Shanghai.

                    <p>One of the main activities of Youtopia is the once-in-a-year fashion & art festivals in Shanghai. As the Head of Media, I have
                        led the media marketing campaign twice for the festival. In our last festival on Aug 2th, we sold our our 300 tickets within three hours!üéá

                    <p>Aside from luanching festivals, I was also in charge of maintaing the content of YOUTOPIA's social media platform.</p>
                    <p>Since I joined, I managed to successfully increase YOUTOPIA's Wechat Official Account's subscribers by 75%,
                        from around 3000 in August 2019 to 7000 now. üçª

                    <h2>Passion for Inclusivity</h2>
                    <p>Although UX Design is not very similar to art, I have always had a passion for art and 
                        lots of my close friends are artists themselves. Born in China, it is not easy to fully pursue
                        a career in art. Seeing the hardships that my artist frineds go through, I wanted to do something
                        that can help them connect with professionals in the fashion & art industry.

                    <p>Although I am pretty happy with what we have done here in YOUTOPIA, I know that there is still a long way
